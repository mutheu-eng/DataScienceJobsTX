Since I have been a data analyst for a long I decide to upgrade to be a data scientist, lucky me I can analyze data science jobs and understand the main key points I'm looking for in a DS job: 
The job titles that pay the highest.
In which city is the salary high?
The field that pays the highest
The companies that pay the highest

Since I will have a junior role first, in this notebook I have outlined the job type based on the salary and many things I would consider when first landing my first job as a data scientist.
